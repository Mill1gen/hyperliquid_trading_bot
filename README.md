## Perps with 10x leverage on HyperLiquid with Python & CCXT Library 
Perps often allow traders to use leverage, meaning they can control larger positions with a smaller amount of capital. 
For example, 10x leverage allows you to trade $10,000 worth of assets with only $1,000.

## Why use perps?
  Flexibility: No need to roll over contracts as you would with traditional futures.
  High Liquidity: Widely traded in crypto markets.
  Ease of Hedging: Useful for managing risk in volatile markets.

## Risks of Trading Perps
  ### Liquidation
    High leverage can lead to your position being liquidated if the market moves against you
  ### Volatility
    Crypto perps are highly volatile, leading to large, quick price movements
  ### Funding Rates
    Perps use a funding rate mechanism to keep the contract price close to the underlying asset price.
    If the perpetual contract price is higher than the spot price, longs pay shorts.
    If the perpetual contract price is lower than the spot price, shorts pay longs.
    creates equilibrium between the contract and the spot market price.
    Holding a position long-term can become expensive due to funding fees.
